Create a Sound Composer project
-------------------------------

The Sound Composer is a tool that allows you to generate the sound of a system by combining the
sounds of its components, which we call sources here. Each source can be made of data coming from
test analysis, or from a simulation, or simply consist of a single audio recording. The sources are
combined into a Sound Composer project, where each source is assigned to a track.

A track is a data structure made of a source data, a source control data, an output gain, and,
optionally, a transfer function in the form of a digital filter (which models the transfer from the
source to the listening/recording position). It can generate the sound of the
component (as characterized by the source data), in specific operating conditions (the source
control), and filtered according to the transfer function.

This example shows how to create a Sound Composer project, with the :class:`.SoundComposer` class.
It first creates a new project, then adds tracks to it, and finally generates the sound of the
project.

The example shows how to perform these operations:

- Create a project,
- Create a track with a source of type Harmonics, and add it to the project,
- Create a track with a source of type Spectrum, and add it to the project,
- Generate the signal of the project,
- Display the spectrogram of the generated signal,
- Save the project as an .scn file.

Create a new Sound Composer project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To create a new Sound Composer project, instantiate the :class:`.SoundComposer` class.
Sources will be combined as tracks into this instance, allowing you to generate the sound of the
project.

Create track #1 for the e-motor source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To model the noise of the e-motor, we create a track with a harmonics source, which contains the
harmonics of the e-motor noise. The track also contains a source control that defines the
operating conditions of the e-motor, and a filter that represents the transfer function of the
e-motor noise source to the receiver point, usually the driver position.

the e-motor, increasing from 250 to 5000 rpm in 8 seconds.

Generate the signal of the project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now, let us generate the signal of the project using the :meth:`.SoundComposer.process()` method.
This method generates, for each track, the acoustic signal of the source, filters it with the
associated filter, if any, and applies the track gain, and finally sums all resulting tracks'
signals together.

Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~
This workflow allows you to analyze and listen to the sound of an e-motor, in
realistic conditions, that is, including the background noise inside the cabin.

By analyzing the spectrogram, you can anticipate how some harmonic tones from the e-motor
may be perceived by the passengers in the cabin.

Further investigations can be conducted, using other tools included in PyAnsys
Sound, such as modules :mod:`Standard levels <ansys.sound.core.standard_levels>`,
:mod:`Psychoacoustics <ansys.sound.core.psychoacoustics>` and
:mod:`Spectral processing <ansys.sound.core.spectral_processing>`.
