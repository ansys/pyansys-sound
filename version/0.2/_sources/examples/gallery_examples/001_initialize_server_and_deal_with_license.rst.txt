Initialize PyAnsys Sound and check out the license
--------------------------------------------------

This example shows how to initialize PyDPF-Core, load DPF Sound, and check out the
required Ansys license (``increment avrxp_snd_level1``) only once. It also shows
how to connect to the DPF server, verify where it is located, and get other useful
information.

This example also demonstrates the use of the LicenseContextManager, a mechanism that lets you
check out the license only once for the duration of the session, which greatly improves performance.
It shows the execution time of a simple DPF Sound operator when you do not use the
LicenseContextManager versus when you do use it.

**Prerequisites**

Ensure that you have installed PyDPF-Core and DPF Sound according to procedures in
the PyDPF-Core documentation:

- If you have installed the latest Ansys release, see `Install using pip
  <https://dpf.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/getting_started/install.html#installation>`_.
- If you want to use the DPF standalone version, see `Install DPF Server
  <https://dpf.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/getting_started/dpf_server.html#dpf-server>`_.

Use a DPF server without a LicenseContextManager

Initialize a DPF server without using a LicenseContextManager.

**Note**: When ``use_license_context=False``, the license is checked out each time
you use a DPF Sound operator.

Use a DPF server with a LicenseContextManager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initialize a DPF server using a LicenseContextManager and execute the same code as run previously.

**Note**: The LicenseContextManager is a mechanism that checks out a license increment
when entering the context and releases it when exiting the context.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 126-147

.. code-block:: Python


    # Connect to a remote server or start a local server using a LicenseContextManager
    print("Connecting to the server using a LicenseContextManager")

You can see that the execution time is much faster when you use a LicenseContextManager.
This is because when a LicenseContactManager is not used, the license is checked out
each time you use a DPF Sound operator.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 153-154

You can release the license increment by deleting the LicenseContextManager object.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 158-161

Now that the LicenseContextManager has been deleted, any new call to a PyAnsys Sound function
will spend time checking out the license increment again. Let us call the same function as before
and measure the execution time again:

    wav_loader = LoadWav(path_flute_wav)

    execution_time = later - now
    print(

    )
