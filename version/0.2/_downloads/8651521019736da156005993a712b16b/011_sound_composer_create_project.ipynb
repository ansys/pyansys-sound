        "\n\n# Create and work with a Sound Composer project\n\nThe Sound Composer is a tool that allows you to generate the sound of a system by combining the\nsounds of its components, which we call sources here. Each source can be made of data coming from\ntest analysis, or from a simulation, or simply consist of a single audio recording. The sources are\ncombined into a Sound Composer project, where each source is assigned to a track.\n\nA track is a data structure made of a source data, a source control data, an output gain, and,\noptionally, a transfer function in the form of a digital filter (which models the transfer from the\nsource to the listening/recording position). It can generate the sound of the\ncomponent (as characterized by the source data), in specific operating conditions (the source\ncontrol), and filtered according to the transfer function.\n\nThis example shows how to create a Sound Composer project, with the :class:`.SoundComposer` class.\nIt first creates a new project, then adds tracks to it, and finally generates the sound of the\nproject.\n\nThe example shows how to perform these operations:\n\n- Create a project,\n- Create a track with a source of type Harmonics, and add it to the project\n- Create a track with a source of type Spectrum, and add it to the project\n- Generate the signal of the project,\n- Display the spectrogram of the generated signal,\n- Save the project as an .scn file.\n"
