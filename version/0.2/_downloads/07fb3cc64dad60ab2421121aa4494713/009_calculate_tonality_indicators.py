Calculate tonality indicators
-----------------------------

This example shows how to calculate tonality indicators.
The list of indicators covered in this example is:

- Annex C of ISO1996-2
- DIN45681
- ECMA418-2
- ISO/TS 20065
- Aures

All these indicators are calculated using the same acoustic signal,
and the results are commented, compared, and discussed.

# From the spectrogram, you can see that the signal contains some tonal components,
# especially the two tones whose frequencies start at around 800 Hz and decrease over the

# ISO 1996-2 annex C
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# In this section, we calculate and print out the tonal audibility of the signal according to
# annex C of the standard ISO 1996-2 using the class :class:`.TonalityISO1996_2`.

# Calculate the ISO 1996-2 tonality.

    f"- tonal adjustment: {tonality_ISO1996_2.get_tonal_adjustment():.1f} dB"
)

# %%
# You can also retrieve computation details using the method
# :meth:`~.TonalityISO1996_2.get_computation_details()`. As you can notice, computing the ISO
# 1996-2 tonality over the whole signal is not relevant, as the tonal audibility equals 0 dB in
# that case, even if strong tonal components are audible. Rigorously speaking, the ISO 1996-2
# standard requires at least 1 minute of stationary signal, which is often a very high bar to reach,
# especially for transient signals. The ISO 1996-2 tonality is therefore not very useful for the
# analysis of transient signals, and it is recommended to use the ISO 1996-2 tonality over time in
# that case.

# %%
# Let us now calculate and plot the ISO 1996-2 tonality over time using the class
# :class:`.TonalityISO1996_2_OverTime`.

# Calculate the ISO 1996-2 tonality over time.

tonality_ISO1996_2_over_time.plot()

# %%
# In this figure, you can notice that the tonal audibility and tonal adjustment show
# strong tonal components near the beginning and the end of the signal.
# Some tonal content is also detected in the middle part of the signal, but less consistently so.
# The most likely reason is that, due to the Doppler effect, the frequencies of the tones are
# changing at a higher rate than in the other parts of the signal.


# %%
# DIN 45681
# ~~~~~~~~~
# In this section, we calculate, print out, and plot the tonality according to the DIN 45681
# standard using the same signal and the class :class:`.TonalityDIN45681`.

# Calculate the DIN 45681 tonality.

    f"(+/-{tonality_DIN45681.get_uncertainty():.1f} dB)\n"
    f"- tonal adjustment: {tonality_DIN45681.get_tonal_adjustment():.1f} dB"
)

# %%
# The DIN 45681 tonality returns results in a similar form as the ISO 1996-2 tonality. However, as
# it is an average of the computed tonality over time, the overall DIN 45681 tonality value is
# more relevant than that of ISO 1996-2, which computes tonality over the entire signal at once.

# Display the results over time in a figure.
tonality_DIN45681.plot()

# %%
# The DIN 45681 "decisive difference", displayed in the figure, is comparable in its definition to
# the ISO 1996-2 tonal audibility over time. However the default time resolution for the
# computation of the two indicators is different (3 s for DIN 45681, 250 ms for ISO 1996-2). In
# both cases, you can change this time resolution using the class properties
# :attr:`.TonalityDIN45681.window_length` for DIN 45681, and
# :attr:`.TonalityISO1996_2_OverTime.window_length` and
# :attr:`.TonalityISO1996_2_OverTime.overlap` for ISO 1996-2.
# Additionally, the DIN 45681 class provides the frequency of the most prominent tone at each
# computation time step, with the method
# :meth:`.TonalityDIN45681.get_decisive_frequency_over_time()`.

# %%
# ISO/TS 20065
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~
# In this section, we calculate, print out, and plot the tonality according to the ISO/TS 20065
# standard using the same signal and the class :class:`TonalityISOTS20065`.

# Calculate the ISO/TS 20065 tonality.

    f"(+/- {tonality_ISOTS20065.get_uncertainty():.1f} dB)"
)

# Display the results over time in a figure.
tonality_ISOTS20065.plot()

# %%
# As you can see from the results, the ISO/TS 20065 tonality is basically the same as the DIN 45681
# tonality. Nonetheless a few minor differences are noteworthy:

# %%
# - the DIN 45681 standard computes a tonal adjustment Kt, meant to be used as a dBA penalty when
#   the sound has tonal components, whereas the ISO/TS 20065 standard does not.
# - the DIN 45681 standard can detect tones down to 90 Hz, whereas this limit is extended to 50 Hz
#   in the ISO/TS 20065 standard. This means that a very low frequency tone (that is, between 50
#   and 90 Hz) can be detected by the ISO/TS 20065 standard, but will most likely be missed by
#   the DIN 45681 standard.
# - Some minor differences in the calculation of the detected tonesâ€™ edge slopes.

# %%
# Aures
# ~~~~~
# In this section, we calculate, print out, and plot the tonality according to Aures model using
# the same signal and the class :class:`.TonalityAures`.

# Calculate the Aures tonality.
tonality_Aures = TonalityAures(signal=signal_aircraft)
tonality_Aures.process()

# Display the overall results in the console.
print(f"Aures tonality: {tonality_Aures.get_tonality():.1f} tu")

# %%
# Contrary to previously mentioned tonality standards, Aures tonality is meant to model the
# perceptual scale of tonality, which is known to have a non-linear relation to spectral peak
# emergence as expressed in decibels. It uses a specific unit called tonality unit (tu), using as a
# reference a 1-kHz pure tone with a level of 60 dB SPL, which is assigned a tonality of 1 tu.

# Display the results over time in a figure.
tonality_Aures.plot()

# %%
# The figure plots the the Aures tonality over time, which is the main value of interest, and the
# tonal component weighting and relative loudness weighting, which are two intermediate
# multiplicative parameters used to calculate the tonality.

# %%
# ECMA 418-2
# ~~~~~~~~~~
# In this section, we calculate, print out, and plot the tonality according to the ECMA 418-2
# standard using  the same signal and the class :class:`.TonalityECMA418_2`.

# Calculate the ECMA 418-2 tonality.
tonality_ECMA418_2 = TonalityECMA418_2(signal=signal_aircraft)
tonality_ECMA418_2.process()

# Display the overall results in the console.
print(
    "Tonality ECMA 418-2 (psychoacoustic tonality): "
    f"{tonality_ECMA418_2.get_tonality():.1f} tuHMS"
)

# %%
# As with the Aures tonality, the ECMA 418-2 standard uses a perceptual scale, with a specific unit
# called tuHMS (tonality unit, hearing model of Sottek). The hearing model of Sottek is a
# perceptual model of sound, where the tonality is computed based on autocorrelation functions
# calculated in each critical band. A value of 1 tuHMS corresponds to the tonality of a 1-kHz pure
# tone with a level of 40 dB SPL. A value of 0 tuHMS indicates that no tonality could be detected
# (that is, no tonal content), while high values in tuHMS indicate prominent tonal contents.


# Display the results over time in a figure.
tonality_ECMA418_2.plot()

# %%
# The figure shows the psychoacoustic tonality over time, as well as the frequency of
# the most prominent tone at each computation time step. The frequency seemingly follows the
# Doppler effect that the previously displayed spectrogram showed, only switching back and forth
# between the two main tones' frequencies.
