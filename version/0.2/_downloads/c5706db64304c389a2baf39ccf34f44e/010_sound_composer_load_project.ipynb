        "\n\n# Use an existing Sound Composer project file\n\nThe Sound Composer is a tool that allows you to generate the sound of a system by combining the\nsounds of its components, which we call sources here. Each source can be made of data coming from\ntest analysis, or from a simulation, or simply consist of a single audio recording. The sources are\ncombined into a Sound Composer project, where each source is assigned to a track.\n\nA track is a data structure made of a source data, a source control data, an output gain, and,\noptionally, a transfer function in the form of a digital filter (which models the transfer from the\nsource to the listening/recording position). It can generate the sound of the\ncomponent (as characterized by the source data), in specific operating conditions (the source\ncontrol), and filtered according to the transfer function.\n\nThis example shows how to use the Sound Composer, with the :class:`.SoundComposer` class. It starts\nfrom an existing Sound Composer project file, and illustrates the notions of Sound Composer project,\ntrack, source, source control, and filter.\n\nThe example shows how to perform these operations:\n\n- Load a project file,\n- Get the project information and content,\n- Investigate the content of a track,\n- Generate the signal of a track,\n- Generate the signal of the entire Sound Composer project.\n"
