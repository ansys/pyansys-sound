Calculate tonality indicators
-----------------------------

This example shows how to calculate tonality indicators.
The list of indicators covered in this example is:

- Annex C of ISO1996-2
- DIN45681
- ECMA-418-2
- ISO/TS 20065
- Aures

All these indicators are calculated using the same acoustic signal,
and the results are commented, compared, and discussed.

Set up analysis

Setting up the analysis consists of loading Ansys libraries, connecting to the
DPF server, and retrieving the example file.

The signal used in this example is the flyover noise of an aircraft. The signal is sampled at
10 kHz, and the duration is about 26 seconds.

From the spectrogram, you can see that the signal contains some tonal components,
especially the two tones whose frequencies start at around 800 Hz and decrease over the
duration of the signal, due to the Doppler effect.

ISO 1996-2 annex C
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this section, we calculate and print out the tonal audibility of the signal according to
annex C of the standard ISO 1996-2 using the class :class:`.TonalityISO1996_2`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 95-107

    ISO 1996-2 tonality:

    - tonal adjustment: 6.0 dB




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 108-116

You can also retrieve computation details using the method
:meth:`~.TonalityISO1996_2.get_computation_details()`. As you can notice, computing the ISO
1996-2 tonality over the whole signal is not relevant, as the tonal audibility equals 0 dB in
that case, even if strong tonal components are audible. Rigorously speaking, the ISO 1996-2
standard requires at least 1 minute of stationary signal, which is often a very high bar to reach,
especially for transient signals. The ISO 1996-2 tonality is therefore not very useful for the
analysis of transient signals, and it is recommended to use the ISO 1996-2 tonality over time in
that case.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 118-120

Let us now calculate and plot the ISO 1996-2 tonality over time using the class
:class:`.TonalityISO1996_2_OverTime`.

In this figure, you can notice that the tonal audibility and tonal adjustment show
strong tonal components near the beginning and the end of the signal.
Some tonal content is also detected in the middle part of the signal, but less consistently so.
The most likely reason is that, due to the Doppler effect, the frequencies of the tones are
changing at a higher rate than in the other parts of the signal.

DIN 45681
~~~~~~~~~
In this section, we calculate, print out, and plot the tonality according to the DIN 45681
standard using the same signal and the class :class:`.TonalityDIN45681`.

The DIN 45681 tonality returns results in a similar form as the ISO 1996-2 tonality. However, as
it is an average of the computed tonality over time, the overall DIN 45681 tonality value is
more relevant than that of ISO 1996-2, which computes tonality over the entire signal at once.

The DIN 45681 "decisive difference", displayed in the figure, is comparable in its definition to
the ISO 1996-2 tonal audibility over time. However the default time resolution for the
computation of the two indicators is different (3 s for DIN 45681, 250 ms for ISO 1996-2). In
both cases, you can change this time resolution using the class properties
:attr:`.TonalityDIN45681.window_length` for DIN 45681, and
:attr:`.TonalityISO1996_2_OverTime.window_length` and
:attr:`.TonalityISO1996_2_OverTime.overlap` for ISO 1996-2.
Additionally, the DIN 45681 class provides the frequency of the most prominent tone at each
computation time step, with the method
:meth:`.TonalityDIN45681.get_decisive_frequency_over_time()`.

    ISO/TS 20065 tonality (mean audibility): 22.4 dB (+/- 1.6 dB)




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 194-196

As you can see from the results, the ISO/TS 20065 tonality is basically the same as the DIN 45681
tonality. Nonetheless a few minor differences are noteworthy:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 198-205

- the DIN 45681 standard computes a tonal adjustment Kt, meant to be used as a dBA penalty when
  the sound has tonal components, whereas the ISO/TS 20065 standard does not.
- the DIN 45681 standard can detect tones down to 90 Hz, whereas this limit is extended to 50 Hz
  in the ISO/TS 20065 standard. This means that a very low frequency tone (that is, between 50
  and 90 Hz) can be detected by the ISO/TS 20065 standard, but will most likely be missed by
  the DIN 45681 standard.
- Some minor differences in the calculation of the detected tones’ edge slopes.

Aures
~~~~~
In this section, we calculate, print out, and plot the tonality according to Aures model using
the same signal and the class :class:`.TonalityAures`.

    Aures tonality: 0.2 tu




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 220-224

Contrary to previously mentioned tonality standards, Aures tonality is meant to model the
perceptual scale of tonality, which is known to have a non-linear relation to spectral peak
emergence as expressed in decibels. It uses a specific unit called tonality unit (tu), using as a
reference a 1-kHz pure tone with a level of 60 dB SPL, which is assigned a tonality of 1 tu.

The figure plots the the Aures tonality over time, which is the main value of interest, and the
tonal component weighting and relative loudness weighting, which are two intermediate
multiplicative parameters used to calculate the tonality.

ECMA-418-2
~~~~~~~~~~
In this section, we calculate, print out, and plot the tonality according to the ECMA-418-2
standard (3rd edition, 2024) using the same signal and the class :class:`.TonalityECMA418_2`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 238-249

    Tonality ECMA 418-2 (psychoacoustic tonality): 1.1 tuHMS




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 250-256

As with the Aures tonality, the ECMA-418-2 standard uses a perceptual scale, with a specific unit
called tuHMS (tonality unit, hearing model of Sottek). The hearing model of Sottek is a
perceptual model of sound, where the tonality is computed based on autocorrelation functions
calculated in each critical band. A value of 1 tuHMS corresponds to the tonality of a 1-kHz pure
tone with a level of 40 dB SPL. A value of 0 tuHMS indicates that no tonality could be detected
(that is, no tonal content), while high values in tuHMS indicate prominent tonal contents.

The figure shows the psychoacoustic tonality over time, as well as the frequency of
the most prominent tone at each computation time step. The frequency seemingly follows the
Doppler effect that the previously displayed spectrogram showed, only switching back and forth
between the two main tones' frequencies.
