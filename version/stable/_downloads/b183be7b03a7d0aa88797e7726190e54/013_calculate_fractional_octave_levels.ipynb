        "\n## Theory\n\nThis section provides details on the different methods used to compute octave- and\none-third-octave-band levels from a time-domain signal and from a power spectral density (PSD).\n\n### Octave and one-third-octave levels\nOctave and one-third-octave levels are analysis methods to assess how the energy of a signal\nis distributed across specific frequency bands, defined logarithmically to better match how the\nfrequency scale is perceived by human ears.\n\nAn octave is the frequency interval between two frequencies that have a ratio of 2. For example,\nthere is exactly one octave between 50 Hz and 100 Hz, but also between 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz.\n\"Octave bands\" are generally understood as a set of 10 predefined, contiguous frequency bands\nextending over one octave exactly and covering the entire audible frequency range. Notably, each\noctave band is twice as wide as the previous one, and half as wide as the next one.\n\nOne-third-octave bands are a further logarithmic subdivision of each octave band into 3 sub-bands.\n\nThe ANSI S1.11-1986 and IEC 61260:1995 standards specify band-pass filters allowing the\ncomputation of 29 one-third-octave-band levels from a time-domain signal. Octave-band levels are\nthen derived from one-third-octave levels by summing the computed energy within each set of 3\nconsecutive one-third-octave bands.\n\n### Levels from signal\nBand level computation in classes :class:`.OneThirdOctaveLevelsFromSignal` and\n:class:`.OctaveLevelsFromSignal` follows the ANSI S1.11-1986 and IEC 61260:1995 standards.\n\n1. The signal is filtered using one-third-octave band-pass filters, resulting in as many\n   band-filtered signals as there are one-third-octaves. Each band-pass filter has a bandwidth of\n   1/3 of an octave.\n2. For each band, the band level is obtained by calculating the overall level of the\n   band-pass-filtered signal.\n3. In the case of octave levels, the band levels are then derived by summing the energies\n   obtained for the 3 consecutive one-third-octave bands within each octave band.\n\nThe figure below illustrates this process.\n\n<img src=\"file://../../_static/_image/example013_method1.png\">\n\n### Levels from PSD\n\nBand level computation in classes :class:`.OneThirdOctaveLevelsFromPSD` and\n:class:`.OctaveLevelsFromPSD`, when attribute\n:attr:`~.OneThirdOctaveLevelsFromPSD.use_ansi_s1_11_1986` is set to ``False`` (default), simply\nconsists of the integration of the PSD over the frequency range corresponding to a each octave or\none-third-octave band.\n\nThe figure below illustrates this process.\n\n<img src=\"file://../../_static/_image/example013_method2.png\">\n\n### Levels from PSD with ANSI S1.11-1986 weighting\n\nBand level computation in classes :class:`.OneThirdOctaveLevelsFromPSD` and\n:class:`.OctaveLevelsFromPSD`, when their attribute\n:attr:`~.OneThirdOctaveLevelsFromPSD.use_ansi_s1_11_1986` is set to ``True``, precedes the\nband-wise PSD integration with a PSD weighting according to the frequency responses of the\nband-pass filters defined in the ANSI S1.11-1986 and IEC61260:1995 standards.\n\nThis allows comparing simulation results with measurements in a meaningful way.\n\n1. For each band, the PSD level values are weighted using the frequency response of the band\n   filter defined in the ANSI S1.11-1986 and IEC61260:1995 standards.\n2. Each band level is then calculated by integrating the weighted PSD over the whole frequency\n   range.\n3. In the case of octave levels, the band levels are again derived by summing the energies\n   obtained for the 3 consecutive one-third-octave bands within each octave band.\n\nThe figure below illustrates this process.\n\n<img src=\"file://../../_static/_image/example013_method3.png\">\n\n"
