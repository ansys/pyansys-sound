Sound composer
--------------

Sound Composer is a module allowing you to generate complex sounds by mixing several tracks.

Each track contains a source, which can be an audio recording, or a set of spectral data
(from a CAE simulation for example), possibly associated to specific control values. The track also
contains control profile(s), an RPM profile for example, that are used to generate the sound, to
replicate a realistic situation.

Each track contains an optional transfer function (filter) to simulate the transfer
between a source and a receiver.

The Sound composer module allows you to create projects including several tracks. Therefore it eases the process of
mixing different source types: harmonics (1 or 2 control parameters), broadband noise (1 or 2 control parameters),
audio, and spectrum.
