Spectrogram processing
----------------------

This module provides useful functions to process signals in the time-frequency domain,
such as the calculation of the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Inverse STFT (ISTFT).

In the case of rotating machines, given the RPM information,
it also allows to isolate specific orders from a spectrogram.
