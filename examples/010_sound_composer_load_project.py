Use an existing Sound Composer project file
-------------------------------------------

The Sound Composer is a tool that allows you to generate the sound of a system by combining the
sounds of its components, which we call sources here. Each source can be made of data coming from
test analysis, or from a simulation, or simply consist of a single audio recording. The sources are
combined into a project, where each source is assigned a track.

A track is a data structure made of source data, source control data, an output gain, and,
optionally, a transfer function in the form of a digital filter. It can generate the sound of the
component (as characterized by the source data), in specific operating conditions (the source
control), and filtered according to the transfer function.

This example shows how to use the Sound Composer, with the :class:`.SoundComposer` class. It starts
from an existing Sound Composer project file, and illustrates the notions of project, track, source,
source control, and filter.

The example shows how to perform these operations:

- Load a project file,
- Get the project information and content,
- Investigate the content of a track,
- Generate the signal of a track,
- Generate the signal of the entire Sound Composer project.

# gearbox may be perceived by the passengers in the cabin.
#
# Further investigations can be conducted, using other tools included in PyAnsys
# Sound, such as modules :mod:`Standard levels <ansys.sound.core.standard_levels>`,
# :mod:`Psychoacoustics <ansys.sound.core.psychoacoustics>` and
