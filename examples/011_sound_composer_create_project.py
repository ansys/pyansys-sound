Create and work with a Sound Composer project
---------------------------------------------

The Sound Composer is a tool that allows you to generate the sound of a system by combining the
sounds of its components, which we call sources here. Each source can be made of data coming from
test analysis, or from a simulation, or simply consist of a single audio recording. The sources are
combined into a Sound Composer project, where each source is assigned to a track.

A track is a data structure made of a source data, a source control data, an output gain, and,
optionally, a transfer function in the form of a digital filter (which models the transfer from the
source to the listening/recording position). It can generate the sound of the
component (as characterized by the source data), in specific operating conditions (the source
control), and filtered according to the transfer function.

This example shows how to create a Sound Composer project, with the :class:`.SoundComposer` class.
It first creates a new project, then adds tracks to it, and finally generates the sound of the
project.

The example shows how to perform these operations:

- Create a project,
- Create a track with a source of type Harmonics, and add it to the project
- Create a track with a source of type Spectrum, and add it to the project
- Generate the signal of the project,
- Display the spectrogram of the generated signal,
- Save the project as an .scn file.

# Create a new Sound Composer project
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# %%
# Create track #1 for the e-motor source
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# To model the noise of the e-motor, we create a track with a harmonics source, which contains the
# harmonics of the e-motor noise. The track also contains a source control that defines the
# operating conditions of the e-motor, and a filter that represents the transfer function of the
# e-motor noise source to the receiver point, usually the driver position.

# %%
# Create a new Sound Composer track, meant as a recipient for the e-motor data.

# source file as an argument. This file contains the levels of the harmonics of the e-motor noise
# for several engine speed values.

# Create track #2 for the wind and road noise source
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# To model the wind and road noise produced in the cabin while driving, we create a track with a
# broadband noise source, whose spectrum envelope changes according to change in the speed of the
# vehicle over time.

# %%
# Generate the signal of the project
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Now, let us generate the signal of the project using the :meth:`.SoundComposer.process()` method.
# This method generates, for each track, the acoustic signal of the source, filters it with the
# associated filter, if any, and applies the track gain, and finally sums all resulting tracks'
# signals together.

# %%
# Generate the signal of the project, using a sampling frequency of 44100 Hz.

# Display the spectrogram of the generated signal using the :class:`.Stft` class.
spectrogram = Stft(signal=generated_signal_from_project)
spectrogram.process()
spectrogram.plot()

# %%
# Save the entire Sound Composer project
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# You can save the Sound Composer project for later use, using the :meth:`.SoundComposer.save()`
# method. This saves the project into a file with the extension "`.scn`" (Sound Composer project
# file). This file can be loaded in Ansys Sound Analysis & Specification.

# %%
# Conclusion
# ~~~~~~~~~~
# This workflow allows you to analyze and listen to the sound of an e-motor, in
# realistic conditions, that is, including the background noise inside the cabin.
#
# By analyzing the spectrogram, you can anticipate how some harmonic tones from the e-motor
# may be perceived by the passengers in the cabin.
#
# Further investigations can be conducted, using other tools included in PyAnsys
# Sound, such as modules :mod:`Standard levels <ansys.sound.core.standard_levels>`,
# :mod:`Psychoacoustics <ansys.sound.core.psychoacoustics>` and
# :mod:`Spectral processing <ansys.sound.core.spectral_processing>`.
