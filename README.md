# ansys-gh-pages-template

This repo is a simple template using
[jekyll-theme-corp](https://github.com/ansys/jekyll-theme-corp) to demonstrate how to generate a GitHub hosted website using the new [Publishing with a custom GitHub Actions workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow). This approach does not require you to create and deploy from a `gh-pages` branch and simplifies building a GitHub Page.

### Usage

You can use this template by:

1. Creating a [New](https://github.com/organizations/ansys/repositories/new) repository within the [github.com/ansys](https://github.com/ansys) organization.
2. Add more content by modifying the existing markdown files and expanding it by following the following documentation:
