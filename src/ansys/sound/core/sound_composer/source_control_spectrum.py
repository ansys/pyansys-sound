    This class stores the source control (that is the sound duration and the sound generation

    Two sound generation methods are offered:

    -   IFFT: sound generation method based on the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform of the input
        spectrum, using random phases.
    -   Hybrid: sound generation method that combines generation of pure tones and IFFT. If peaks
        are detected in the input spectrum, they are generated as pure tones (sine waves). The rest
        is synthesized using the IFFT method.
