    Notes
    -----
    For consistency with other Ansys Sound applications, octave-band levels are derived from
    one-third-octave levels, and frequency weighting is applied before the conversion. In other
    words, each octave-band level is obtained by summing the 3 one-third-octave levels within
    (in squared units), each weighted with the frequency weighting obtained at the
    one-third-octave-band center frequency. Note that the highest-frequency octave band
    (centered at 16000 Hz) is obtained by only summing the 2 highest one-third-octave bands
    (since the 30th one-third-octave band centered at 20000 Hz is not considered).
