class Filter(SignalProcessingParent):
    r"""Filter class.

    This class allows designing, loading, and applying a digital filter to a signal. The filter
    coefficients can be provided directly, using the attributes :attr:`b_coefficients` and
    :attr:`a_coefficients`, or computed from a specific frequency response function (FRF), using
    the attribute :attr:`frf` or the method :meth:`design_FIR_from_FRF_file`. In this latter case,
    the filter is designed as a minimum-phase FIR filter, and the filter denominator
    (:attr:`a_coefficients`) is set to 1 as a consequence.

    Note that only one filter definition source (coefficients, FRF, or FRF file) can be provided
    when instantiating the class. After class instantiation, any time the coefficients are
    changed, the FRF is updated accordingly, and vice versa.

    Filtering a signal consists of applying the filter coefficients :math:`b[k]` and :math:`a[k]`
    in the following difference equation, with :math:`x[n]` the input signal, and :math:`y[n]` the
    output signal:

    .. math::
        y[n] = \sum_{k=0}^{N} b[k] \cdot x[n-k] - \sum_{k=1}^{N} a[k] \cdot y[n-k]

    .. note::
        Whether they are derived from the provided FRF or specified directly, the filter
        coefficients are linked to the sampling frequency value that is given in the
        ``sampling_frequency`` parameter of the ``Filter`` class. As a consequence, the signal to
        filter :attr:`signal` must have the same sampling frequency. If necessary, use the
        :class:`.Resample` class to resample the signal prior to using the ``Filter`` class.
